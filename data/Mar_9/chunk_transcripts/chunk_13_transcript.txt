[2:00:00]things in there.
[2:00:01]Definitely.
[2:00:02]I mean, to be honest with you, I did try to read the last paper, this one, and try to
[2:00:06]understand it, but I failed.
[2:00:08]It's very complicated, and it needs some level of biological understanding and chemical science
[2:00:13]understanding, but they have released so many papers, so I believe that, you know, if we
[2:00:20]can just go through them, maybe we can learn the tricks behind this, and probably some
[2:00:23]people are interested in the field, but very mind-blowing research, and I guess this is
[2:00:28]going to be another trend like quantum computing that is coming up.
[2:00:33]Now we might also see this biological computing to be another trend following that.
[2:00:39]Not maybe very soon, but these systems are evolving, and, you know, now that we just
[2:00:44]see the first version that could be purchased, who knows, maybe in one year, two years, three
[2:00:48]years, we see now more and more powerful versions of those as well.
[2:00:52]Exactly.
[2:00:53]And I'm also thinking about how this similar technology could be used in the other way
[2:00:58]to augment our own brains with AI instead of augmenting digital world with biological
[2:01:05]neurons, and this is the area that really excites me about the future, to augment our
[2:01:11]consciousness with AI or with computers, basically, in a way that we have a way to convey our
[2:01:19]thoughts, our feelings into machines in a very efficient way, not just with words.
[2:01:25]I mean, imagine, I think we covered this in the previous episode as well, to just be able to
[2:01:34]talk to computers in a much more efficient way than just words, or look at it in this way,
[2:01:41]instead of just training models on the purpose of words that are generated by humans,
[2:01:48]training them on the neural activity of humans that then gets translated into words by our brain.
[2:01:57]But, you know, if you trained on the raw signals of the neurons before they're translated into
[2:02:05]words by our brain, I mean, that would be a much more detailed data sets to train
[2:02:13]models on, and I think lots of more intricate relationships will be found in that sort of data set.
[2:02:20]I think that is a really exciting line of research that will be soon, I think,
[2:02:27]available probably in the next few years. That's the first step towards a cyberpunk kind of world.
[2:02:34]I mean, we are just moving to cyberpunk, and I'm very happy because I do like cyberpunk 27.7 game,
[2:02:40]so I really hope that by the time that I'm gonna leave, I see something like that happening in this world.
[2:02:45]Anyways, these are very futuristic kind of works, and then I don't have anything
[2:02:52]else apart from some tools and resources to share, so I guess this is also the kind of case
[2:02:57]with you as well, so feel free to share your screen, and let's go ahead and maybe do a last round of...
[2:03:03]Yeah, sure, and okay, let me bring up the Product Hunt list here.
[2:03:20]Okay, at the end of each year, Product Hunt, which is a website that the new tools
[2:03:28]in technology, not just AI, is introduced by its developers and are voted and ranked by the
[2:03:38]users in the community. At the end of each year, Product Hunt kind of like
[2:03:44]gathers a list of the winners based on the people's votes, and it's called the Golden Kitty Awards,
[2:03:50]and these are for the 2024, so we know lots of new and mostly AI-powered tools were introduced
[2:03:57]in 2024, at least a lot of focus was on AI. There are other tools that are not AI-focused
[2:04:05]or not AI-first in this list, but as you can see, the winner is Cursor, so this is the winner
[2:04:12]of all the categories, and it is Cursor, the AI code editor, and you can probably guess what
[2:04:19]impact it had on the developer communities that basically most of the people voting for
[2:04:26]these products are developers, so if developers picked this, they had probably a really good
[2:04:31]experience using this tool, and it's going to be probably the future of maybe development,
[2:04:37]at least on the indie or independent developers. Maybe it takes some time for companies to take
[2:04:44]on this Cursor AI tool as a companion to their developer teams, but for independent developers,
[2:04:53]this will be a great help, and I think we covered this in the previous section as well,
[2:05:00]and the runner-ups were Superbase, which is a really cool tool that I just found out from this
[2:05:06]list, but it has long been around, I just hadn't heard about it before, and the OpenAI Award.
[2:05:15]I'm going to cover this in here. Superbase is basically a service, is backend as a service,
[2:05:24]so it provides tools for making very efficient and scalable backends, like the services that
[2:05:33]you need for database services, need for authentication of the users when they want
[2:05:38]to register to your website, or some of these serverless features as a service, basically,
[2:05:47]so you don't need to serve your own database on your own machine, you just use their API and
[2:05:57]use their database as a service, and let me share the, I think I'm sharing one tab here, and I need
[2:06:06]to, let me share my desktop so I don't have to reshare my screen every time I open a tab.
[2:06:17]I think you can see my whole screen here now with all the tabs. Yeah, this is the
[2:06:25]Superbase website. It is basically an open source Firebase alternative. Firebase is a service by
[2:06:32]Google that has been lying around. It's not open source, it's closed source, but it was maybe one
[2:06:39]of the most successful backend as a service tools that was provided to the developer community,
[2:06:47]so that people didn't have to just develop everything from scratch, have their own
[2:06:52]database. They could use a database served on Google servers, but connected to their other parts,
[2:06:59]other components by some API, and it is the open source version or alternative to Firebase,
[2:07:07]and the cool thing is that the free tier version of Superbase provides lots of cool and
[2:07:15]lots of interesting features that are sufficient for running maybe a small to medium
[2:07:23]size website, and then for the more advanced and those that need a really high scale scenarios,
[2:07:30]you can go to the paid plans, but the free plan, as I investigated, provides lots of
[2:07:41]features for free. That is cool, and I'm thinking to maybe whenever I wanted to build that personal
[2:07:47]blog, maybe I use some of these features from here and don't develop it on myself, but most of the
[2:07:53]time these features and this service basically is more suitable for the big companies that they
[2:08:01]want to be scalable and they don't want to risk the authentication part to be, I don't know,
[2:08:09]easy to scam or something, and they also provide vector embeddings, which is cool. So this was the
[2:08:18]second kind of runner-up for the title of the winner here, and the first, the winner in
[2:08:27]the developers tool after the cursor, but cursor generally was the winner of the whole category
[2:08:33]based on probably the votes. The other cool tool was Bolt. I think I introduced it to you
[2:08:44]someday, I'm not sure, but it wasn't recorded in the episodes. It's basically a tool,
[2:08:51]yeah, it's basically a simple, here at least, interface that lets you type in the app you
[2:08:57]want to develop and start developing it, as unbelievable as that sounds, and I tried it with
[2:09:06]some ideas and it is good on the HTML CSS part. It probably takes a lot of prompt engineering
[2:09:17]and trial and error to make a whole functioning website with it, and it's not probably very
[2:09:23]efficient on, I don't know, handling the database or something like that, but it is definitely a good
[2:09:31]starting point if you have some idea to work on and want to just play with the idea and see
[2:09:39]how you can develop it as fast as possible. As I said, the web coding thing, and see
[2:09:45]if that is feasible to do, and I saw some of the tutorials on YouTube that were using this tool as
[2:09:55]the main kind of like tool to develop the frontend.
